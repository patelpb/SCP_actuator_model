Introduction:
The objective of this research is to study the construction of super-coiled polymer (SCP) actuators and develop an integration technique with printable robotics.

Materials:
In order to create the actuators, the following list of materials is required:
-Stand clamp (https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Grade-Metalware-Set-Support/dp/B00HUUWYIO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1484636385&sr=8-2&keywords=stand+clamp)
-Drill/Motor 
-Weight set (https://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Scientific-Economy-Weight-Plastic/dp/B00EPQMEWC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1484616184&sr=8-4&keywords=50+gram+weight+with+hook)
-Conductive sewing thread
-Paper Clips (https://www.amazon.com/ACCO-Paper-Clips-Economy-Non-skid/dp/B001B0D5T6/ref=sr_1_2?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1484636553&sr=1-2&keywords=paper+clips)
-Rod/Pencil to tether base against rotation
-Heat gun or hair dryer

Procedure:
1.	Attach motor to stand clamp. 
2.	Attach a paper clip to both ends of the conductive sewing thread. 
3.	Hook one paper clip onto the motor shaft and the other side to a weight.
4.	Tether the weight against rotation to allow the fiber to twist near/beyond the point of coiling. 
5.	Turn on the motor and allow for the coils to form within the thread. 
6.	In order to “anneal” the actuators, the threads must be heated to 150 degrees Celsius and then cooled to room temperature. This process must be repeated 10-20 times in order to ensure that the actuator reaches the resting length.
7.	After the annealing process, a DC servo motor or a heat gun (hair dryer) may be used to actually test actuation. When heat is applied, the actuator will contract.
