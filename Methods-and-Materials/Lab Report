Introduction:
The objective of this research is to study the construction of super-coiled polymer (SCP) actuators and develop an integration technique with printable robotics.

Materials:
In order to create the actuators, the following list of materials is required:

	•	Stand clamp (https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Grade-Metalware-Set-Support/dp/B00HUUWYIO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1484636385&sr=8-2&keywords=stand+clamp)

	•	Motor 
	•	Weight set (https://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Scientific-Economy-Weight-Plastic/dp/B00EPQMEWC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1484616184&sr=8-4&keywords=50+gram+weight+with+hook)

	•	Conductive sewing thread 
	•	Paper Clips (https://www.amazon.com/ACCO-Paper-Clips-Economy-Non-skid/dp/B001B0D5T6/ref=sr_1_2?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1484636553&sr=1-2&keywords=paper+clips)
	•	Rod/Pencil to tether base against rotation
	•	Oven

Procedure:
1.	Tighten the clamp on the stand clamp around the base of the motor, ensuring that the shaft of the motor is facing the front.
2.	Tie a knot around a paper clip at both ends of the conductive sewing thread. Both ends should look be identical.
3. 	Add a hook onto the shaft of the motor using a rubber spacer. Tighten the rubber spacer onto the motor shaft on one end and onto the hook on the end.
4.	Hook one paper clip onto the hook attached to the motor shaft and hook the weight through the other paper clip on the other side of the string
5.	In order to tether the weight against rotation to allow the fiber to twist near/beyond the point of coiling, one must loop a pencil or rod through the paper clip at the bottom of the string to prevent rotation. 
6.	Turn on the motor and allow for the coils to form within the thread. 
7.	In order to “anneal” the actuators, the threads must be heated to 65 degrees Celsius for 90 minutes. This will allow the actuators to set.
8.	After the annealing process, a DC servo motor or a heat gun (hair dryer) may be used to actually test actuation. When heat is applied, the actuator will contract.
