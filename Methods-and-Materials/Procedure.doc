Procedure:
Creating SCP Actuators
Twist Insertion:
1.	Hang a weight (50 grams) from one end of the fiber and attach the other end to the shaft of a motor. 
2.	Ensure that the weight is also tethered against rotation to make sure that every turn of the motor corresponds to the addition of only one twist into the wire.
3.	Keep fiber taut to allow the fiber to twist to near/beyond point of coiling.
4.	Servo/Stepper motor can be used to measure applied twist per length.
 
Heat Treatment:
1.	After thread is properly coiled, apply voltage potential to the wire (~0.2W/cm), which heats coils to above 150 degrees Celsius.
a.	Repeat 20 times until resting length converges
2.	To prevent SCP actuators from twisting, 2-plys are formed, using two of the coiled threads and twisting them together.
3.	Resultant rest length (at 20 degrees) should be around 100 mm.
